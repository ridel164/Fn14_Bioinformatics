# TNFRSF12A_Bioinformatics-
This repository is for storing bioinformatic data as part of my MSc Genetics Thesis. Included within is commands for downloading WGS SRA files through to Variant calling and Annotating them.  
All work outlined in this repository is part of the Cunliffe Laboratory at The University of Otago. 

## Outline of Project
The purpose of this aim is to analyse breast cancer cell line sequences, and compare variants between cell lines with high and low expression of TNFRSF12A. Breast cacner cell lines MDAMB231 and BT549 have been chosen as high expressing cell lines where as, MCF7 and T47D have been chosen as low expressing. These decision have been made in line with published literature. 

### Project Setup and Directories
The Cunliffe laboratory high capacity storage (HCS) space has been used as the main directory  for outputdata and storage of scripts. Additional HCS spaces within the University of Otago have been used for access to modules, the reference genome, and designed annotation script.
